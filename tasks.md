# Task Board

## Ready

### Add the PCB sponsor to the Credits page
`docs/credits.md` → "Partners & sponsors" (TODO comment left in the file).
Confirm the actual PCB fabrication sponsor's company name — the repo only says
"JLCPCB-style" (a generic paid fab), never names a sponsor. Rubén to provide.
Kart sponsors already listed: Festo, Cytron, Henakart, RB Sistemas.

### Split the medulla's ground terminals between GND and GND_SIG
The harness now has two grounds: `GND` (power) and `GND_SIG` (sensors, black + white
stripe), tied only at the rear ground Wago block near the battery and the 12 V / 24 V
regulators. All three medulla ground terminals (CN1.3, CN9.3, CN10.3) are still on the
power `GND` net in `docs/assembly/electronics/wiring/wiring.yaml`, because which of them
the PCB routes to its analog ground is not recorded here. Check the authoritative KiCad
project (`dv-hardware/projects/kart-medulla`): if the board has separate analog and power
grounds, move the analog terminal to `GND_SIG`; if it has one ground plane, say so in
`wiring.md` so nobody assumes the split reaches the board.

### Redraw the wiring SVG for the two-ground split
`docs/assembly/electronics/wiring/images/wiring-global.svg` is hand-drawn and still shows
one common ground. It needs the `GND_SIG` return, the rear Wago star point, and the
striped-black convention, otherwise the diagram and the generated wire table disagree.
Background on the two-ground split: `docs/assembly/electronics/wiring.md`, section
"Why two grounds".

### `mkdocs build` warns "Failed to generate LLM files"
Every build prints `Warning: Failed to generate LLM files:` with an empty reason, so
`llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` may be stale. Reproduces on a clean checkout, so it is not
caused by any recent docs edit. Find the swallowed exception in `generate_llm_files.py` /
`generate_llm_hook.py` and either fix it or make the hook report the real error.

## Done

### Build Journey section (2026-07-10)
Ported the portfolio's build-journey into kart-docs as a team-shareable section:
`docs/build-journey/index.md` + images/videos under `docs/build-journey/{images,videos}/`,
nav entry, `attr_list`/`md_in_html`/`pymdownx.emoji` extensions, and a primary
"Read the Build Journey" button at the bottom of the home page. Added the 2026-07-10
"first autonomous drive" post (latest LinkedIn). NOTE: the 2026-07-08 "steering gear
materials" (PPA) post is published but intentionally not added yet.

### Credits page (2026-07-10)
`docs/credits.md` — contributors (subsystem-tagged, one list, append-only) + partners &
sponsors. Full names resolved from the Notion workspace member list. Team members add their
own LinkedIn/GitHub via the GitHub "Edit" pencil (git-practice on-ramp); how-to is a source
comment, not shown on the page. Lead entry kept modest — shared work (ROS 2, dashboard)
credited to the people who did it, not the lead.
