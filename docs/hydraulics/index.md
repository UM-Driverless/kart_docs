## Brake Pressure Sensor


We are using flexible brake hoses with M10x1.0 female connectors. Our pressure sensor is the Sensata PTE7100, code `PTE7100-33CC-2E200BN`, [datasheet here](../assets/datasheets/sensata_pte7100_hermetic_analog_pressure_sensor_da-1919220.pdf), [mouser here](https.www.mouser.es/ProductDetail/Sensata-Technologies/PTE7100-32DC-0B200BN?qs=sGAEpiMZZMv1xWCHBjbGeVR9W0yhknQ8lfjrm5f%2FK5xVuiB%2F1oy1aA%3D%3D).

- 7/16-20 UNF-2A (MALE) pressure port
- Packard Metri-Pack 150 connector
- HNBR o-ring
- 1-5Vdc/8-32Vdc
- 0â€“200 bar pressure range
- no mating connector or snubber
- To connect the sensor to the brake lines, we use a male M10x1.0 to female 1/4-18NPT adapter.
